âš¡ Fun Facts
- I love culinary arts! I used to cook at restaurants during the summers, but now I cook as a hobby (and because I need to eat). I'm trying to find the best ragu recipe, so if you have one, send it my way!
- I've always been fascinated by literature. If you've read something fascinating lately, I'd love to hear about it.
